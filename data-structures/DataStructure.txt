The list type:
x[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
The list is mutable(add, delete and change values)

x=(1,2,3,4,5)
A tuple is like a list but it is immutable.

A dictionary is a sequence of key-value pairs.
x={"a":1,"b":2,"c":3}
In other languages, this maybe called an associative array or an hashed array.

A set is indicated with curly brackets.
